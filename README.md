College Gym Footfall Prediction
This project predicts hourly crowd levels (occupancy percentage) in a college gym using synthetic data stored in a SQLite database and traditional machine learning models. It demonstrates how to move from a basic model to a small, production‑like pipeline with SQL, Python scripts, model versioning, and a Streamlit dashboard.
